# react-simple-v1

### Are you looking for a React Application to start building your stuffs?

Basically, I implement few code, just the necessary to start building great stuffs.

Some steps to configurate are showed below:
1. Execute [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html) tutorial and create your own envirenment;
1. Use CLI __create-router-app__ to generate a new project;
1. After that, enter in project folder and run this command:
```bash
# yarn add react-router-dom
```
Now you had everything configurated, so lets code!

1. Start you dev envirenment with:
```bash
# yarn start
```

If you have any questions or find a bug, text me.
Feel free to folk my project. :)

Thanks for you interest.

Cya :D

*Notes: __This is a react-dom project.__*
